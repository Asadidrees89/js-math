				Assignment Description
			</h3>
			<p>
				Start thinking about how to use code to solve more logical problems. As much as web development is an expression of creativity, it's also based in problem solving (and job interviewers certainly know that) so you'll want to shake the rust off that part of your brain. Project Euler is a series of programming challenges that are best solved by using the power of computers (since many of them require you to perform simple mathematical operations on a very large scale). Some of the later problems require so much repetition and computing power that you would need to find a more elegant way of solving it than the immediately obvious "brute force" solution. We'll just go through the first one now, it's all we need at this point. Solve these problem in <a href="https://repl.it/languages/javascript">repl.it</a> if you aren't comfortable working with your own files:
				<br>
				<a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=1">Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5</a>. Go ahead and read the assignment. Now, lets break it down into a few steps. The first thing we have to know is how to check if a number is a multiple of 3 or 5 (in case you don't remember, a multiple of a number is that number multiplied by an integer), a hint for doing this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/17525046/4330173">Modulus operator</a>. Next, we need to sum all the numbers that are multiples, so we'll need a variable to keep track of that sum. And lastly, we need to iterate(remember how to do a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">loop</a> in javascript?) through all the numbers until we get to 1000. With all this, we should be able to solve the problem. In case you are still struggling, check out other students solutions for inspiration.

			<h4>
				My 2 Cents
			</h4>
			<p>
				Im going to modify this assignment a little. Instead of using only Javascript to solve the problem, I'm going to create a web-based user interface for this assignment and ask the user to type any 2 numbers between 1-10 and get the sum of all their multiples that lie within a range specified by the user.

				Assignment Description
			</h3>
			<p>
				Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
				<br><br>
				<span id=fibseq>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</span>
				<br><br>
				By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

			</p>
			<h4>
				My 2 Cents
			</h4>
			<p>
				Instead of fixing the limit to 4 million, I'll keep it flexible by asking the user to set the limit up to which they'd like to find the sum of either even or odd or all values in the fibonacci sequence.
